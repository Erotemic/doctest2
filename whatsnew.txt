Version 0.4.1
-------------
* Fixed bug with reporting ellapsed time in native runner


Version 0.4.0
-------------
* Added auto parsing style. This first tries to use Google, but falls back on
  freeform if no google-style doctests are found.
* Errors are no longer printed twice if only a single test is being run.
* All parsers now default to the new "auto" style.
* Added command "dump" to native runner that reformats enabled doctests so they
  can be run as unit tests.
* Implemented delayed want mtaching. This enables doctests to use multiple
  print statements in a row and use a single want statement to check all of
  their output.
* Colorized doctest now highlights "want" lines in a distinct (green) color
